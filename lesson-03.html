			<h2>Lesson 3: Is instructional design future proof?</h2>
			<p>Opportunities in instructional design are predicted to grow in the 21st century, particularly in instructional technologies. The Bureau of Labor Statistic Occupational Handbook (see link at the end) states that, <em>"Employment of training and development specialists is projected to grow 11 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations."</em></p>
			<p>Of course, I can't predict the future. But, here are seven reasons why I think this field has so much potential.</p>
			<h3>1. Online training is mainstream</h3>
			<p>At one time, employers flew their geographically dispersed employees to one site for a training event, paying for travel, lodging and food. Now that the internet infrastructure is strong in large portions of the world, eLearning courses and online seminars are becoming mainstream approaches to training. Online training is less expensive and requires fewer hours away from work than face-to-face training. More instructional designers will be needed to produce technology-based training.</p>
			<h3>2. Mobile learning and apps are part of the solution</h3>
			<p>With the ubiquitous presence of mobile phones and tablets, there are increasing opportunities to provide employees with learning opportunities and performance support out in the field. More instructional designers will be needed to design mobile learning and performance support applications.</p>
			<h3>3. Social media learning is on the increase</h3>
			<p>Learning through social media and collaboration tools, such as Twitter, Facebook, Slack, LinkedIn Groups, chat rooms, forums, blogging and content curation, are how savvy people are learning informally. It's a way to stay up-to-date and provides the social interaction lacking in most formal self-paced training. People who understand social media and learning will be needed to integrate these approaches into workplace learning.</p>
			<h3>4. Distance learning in higher education is hot</h3>
			<p>Colleges and universities are finding that distance education is an effective way to attract and educate students who can't spend years on campus. This approach brings in additional revenue and accommodates non-traditional students. Even free and open online courses extend the university's reach. Instructional designers will be needed to help faculty design and teach online.</p>
			<h3>5. Educational technology is booming</h3>
			<p>Students from kindergarten through high school are playing educational games, doing online research, and using technology to learn and communicate in and outside of the classroom. Educational and instructional technologists will be needed to design and support technology-based education.</p>
			<h3>6. Continuous learning is mandatory</h3>
			<p>We live in a time when information changes quickly. The knowledge and skills required for many jobs nearly demands continuous learning. Learning designers will be needed to support, encourage and create learning experiences for lifelong learners.</p>
			<h3>7. The future is now</h3>
			<p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are emerging as solutions to complex workplace performance issues. These newer technologies provide safe ways to simulate workplace situations as well as ways to support employees on the job. Artificial Intelligence provides assistance to customers and employees when they have questions or run into problems in the form of chatbots and other applications. Learning experience designers who can keep up with the pace of change will be in demand for these and future technologies.</p>
			<p>These are just some of the indicators that a career in instructional design will thrive in the 21st century.</p>
