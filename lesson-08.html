			<h2>Lesson 8: Do you need a degree in instructional design?</h2>
			<p>Although most instructional designers have college degrees, a surprising number do not have an advanced degree in instructional design, performance improvement, or a similar credential. Thus, there is an ongoing debate among practitioners as to the importance of a graduate degree in the field.</p>
			<p>Instructional designers without degrees come from a wide range of backgrounds, including education, writing, programming, and media production. Others entered the field because they were experts in a particular subject or software product and were asked to create training.</p>
			<p>In a survey of over 500 instructional design professionals, there was agreement on one thing: both a degree and a strong skill set are the ideal combination. (Shank, 2012)</p>
			<h3>There Are Advantages to Getting a Degree</h3>
			<p>Though there are usually benefits to getting an advanced degree, you'll find many examples of successful instructional designers, managers, executives and leaders in the field who do not have one.</p>
			<p>Some typical reasons for getting a degree include: knowledge and skill development, increased pay, and potential for greater career opportunities.</p>
			<p>In my opinion (I know you didn't ask), a degree program that provides a basis in cognitive psychology and learning theory is a valuable foundation for becoming a learning professional. Furthermore, interaction with students and professors can enhance one's education.</p>
			<h3>On the other hand...</h3>
			<p>You may be in a life or work situation where going to school is out of the question. And it's true that any highly motivated individual can study learning theory and cognitive psychology without going to school. Also, it is possible to seek out thoughtful discussions outside of the college environment. So, don't feel that there aren't opportunities for you too. In fact, this course makes no assumptions as to whether a degree is necessary.</p>
			<h3>Important Resource</h3>
			<p>If you are interested in checking out degree and certificate programs, see my link in Resources at the end of this lesson. I maintain a growing list of programs at The eLearning Coach site.</p>
			<h3>There Are Alternative Options</h3>
			<p>Not everyone has the time, money or desire to enroll in a graduate program. If obstacles prevent you from getting a degree, here are a few ways to overcome the obstacles or to find degree alternatives.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Employer Reimbursement.</strong> If tuition is a problem, some employers will pay all or part of your school expenses, if you agree to stick around for a specified number of years</li>
				<li><strong>Online Programs.</strong> If you're short on time, consider online graduate programs. These may provide the flexible schedule you need.</li>
				<li><strong>Certificate Programs.</strong> Consider an instructional design or eLearning design certificate program provided by an accredited college or university. These require fewer courses but you still end up with a credential.</li>
				<li><strong>CPLP Credential.</strong> Look into the Certified Professional in Learning and Performance (CPLP) credential from the Association for Talent  Development (ATD). This credential shows that you've studied and passed a professional exam in the field. See the resources at the end for the link.</li>
				<li><strong>Professional Development.</strong> Professional development courses in instructional and eLearning design are given by commercial training companies and as pre-conference workshops.</li>
				<li><strong>Self-study.</strong> Self-study is an option if you're motivated. Read instructional design and eLearning design books. Then develop the technical, graphic and writing skills to create an eLearning portfolio. <em>You'll get book suggestions and more on creating a portfolio in lessons 11 and 12.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How to Find the Best Program for Your Goals</h3>
			<p>If you decide to enroll in a degree or certificate program, choose a curriculum that prepares you for the career path you'd like to follow.</p>
			<p>For example, three different types of career goals would be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>designing training for the workplace</li>
				<li>academic research</li>
				<li>working in a school system</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These are three different goals that would benefit from three different types of degree programs.</p>
			<p>If you want to stay with your current employer, ask your boss or other supervisors what type of concentration would be best.</p>
			<h3>What would the ideal program include?</h3>
			<p>The ideal program will include both theory and practice. Try to find one that includes at least some of the following components:</p>
			<p><strong>Theory.</strong> The theory provides the understanding required to make intelligent decisions based on learning research. Ideally, this will include cognitive psychology or cognitive science and learning theory.</p>
			<p><strong>Practice.</strong> The practice component provides skills needed to produce training and educational materials. Look for programs that provide development in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instructional design (creating online courses, manuals and job aids from start to finish)</li>
				<li>Communication (speaking and writing skills; practice communicating with clients)</li>
				<li>Authoring Tools (for building online courses)</li>
				<li>Visual design skills (although not common, any multimedia design skills are a plus)</li>
				<li>Media production skills (video and audio recording, editing, production)</li>
				<li>Web development (these often go unused, but good to know just in case)</li>
				<li>Social media tools and how to use them for learning purposes</li>
				<li>Project management and business</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Experience.</strong> The ideal program will also include ways to get real-world experience, either in a commercial, non-profit or academic setting through internships or part-time work.</p>
			<p><strong>Independent Study.</strong> Solid programs should give you some opportunity to study areas of interest to you. You might incorporate your interests into your master's thesis or report, or there may be an independent study option where you can design your own study plan.</p>
