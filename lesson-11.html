			<h2>Lesson 11: Get a Head Start with These Books</h2>
			<p>One of the best ways to get acquainted with the field is to start reading the books that students and practitioners read. Here are some options.</p>
			<h3>Instructional Design Books</h3>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/design-for-how-people-learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design for How People Learn (2nd edition)</a> by Julie Dirksen<br>
			This smartly-written book presents the principles of learning, memory and attention that should underlie experiences that help people learn. Ms. Dirksen helps readers see that it's possible to make learning meaningful while still being engaging and fun.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1562869140/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1562869140&linkCode=as2&tag=theelearningc-20&linkId=HIQUWWH2DNYIFAAO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Accidental Instructional Designer</a> by Cammy Bean<br>
			If you became an instructional designer through happenstance, fate or necessity, you'll love Cammy Bean's practical and real-world look at the field. She takes the reader on a journey through the practice of instructional design, presenting a sensible approach to learning models, finding a hook, interactivity, writing and more. This is a good book for both accidental and intentional learning designers.</p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/essentials-of-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Essentials of Instructional Design (3rd edition)</a> by Abbie Brown and Timothy D. Green<br>
			<em>The Essentials of Instructional Design</em> covers the foundations of instructional design including the principles, processes and practices without subscribing to a particular model. It is used as a graduate school textbook and the second edition has assignments at the end of each chapter. A bit pricey though.</p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/isd-from-ground-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISD From the Ground Up: A No-Nonsense Approach to Instructional Design (3rd edition)</a> by Chuck Hodell<br>
			This well-liked book is considered a primer on instructional design, taking readers through the steps of the ADDIE model. The focus is more on instructional design for classroom facilitation than for eLearning. It is organized into four clearly-written sections: The Basics of ISD, Working Through the ADDIE Model, The Basics of Design and Lesson Plans and Tips for Success.</p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/rapid-instructional-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapid Instructional Design: Learning ID Fast and Right (2nd edition)</a><br>
			Rapid Instructional Design provides a practical approach to instructional design, walking the reader through all the steps. It addresses instructor-led training, online learning and includes some case studies. This is considered a book for practitioners rather than those looking for theory.</p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/systematic-design-of-instruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Systematic Design of Instruction</a> by Walter Dick, Lou Carey and James O. Carey<br>
			If you're interested in a graduate school classic, you'll like this book. The well-known Dick and Carey model was a breakthrough approach at one time. These days, some think it's overly complicated and prefer the more rapid approach to instructional design. It will, however, introduce you to a model that is somewhat different than ADDIE and provide a thorough look at designing instruction.</p>
			<h3>eLearning and Distance Education Books</h3>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/elearning-science-of-instruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-Learning and the Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning</a> by Ruth Clark<br>
			This book provides design principles for multimedia learning that are based on research. It answers questions that practitioners often ask themselves, such as how and when to mix pictures and text; when to use audio in animation; and similar issues. Although there is overlap with more basic books, <em>eLearning and the Science of Instruction</em> also covers more advanced topics.</p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/elearning-by-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-Learning by Design</a> by William Horton<br>
			Like other books on eLearning design and development, <em>e-Learning by Design</em> takes you through the process of designing and creating eLearning. Unlike other books, Mr. Horton also writes about a variety of activities to include in your eLearning. He covers different types of learning activities that fit into three categories: Absorb, Do and Connect.</p>
			<p>You'll also find chapters on tests, structure, social learning, games and simulation and much more. <em>Note: Reviewers who read this on a tablet device are disappointed by the poor formatting.</em></p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/better-than-bullet-points" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Than Bullet Points: Creating Engaging e-Learning with PowerPoint</a> by Jane Bozarth<br>
			Many of the rapid eLearning tools start with PowerPoint slides. <em>Better Than Bullet Points</em> explains ways to create engaging eLearning that pushes the envelope beyond generic bullet points. In ten chapters, the book covers designing for your learners, user interface, creating graphics, animation, interactivity, add-ons, multimedia and delivery and support. This is a good practical guide for someone who wants to get started using PowerPoint.</p>
			<p><a href="http://breakingintoid.com/essentials-of-course-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essentials of Online Course Design: A Standards-based Guide (3rd edition)</a> by Marjorie Vai and Kristen Sosulski<br>
			In <em>Essentials of Online Course Design</em>, the authors state it is written for a wide audience, from teachers to higher education to the professional workplace training staff. With its distance education perspective, it may be most appropriate for educational technologists.</p>
			<p>The book presents the features and components of online learning and lightly covers writing style and visual design basics. It then presents ways to engage the learner and covers assessment activities. Some appendices are included.</p>
			<p>You'll find many more books on Amazon. This is just a sampling.</p>
