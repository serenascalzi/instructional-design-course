			<h2>Lesson 6: The 12 Opportunities of Instructional Design</h2>
			<p>If you decide to start a career in instructional design, you don't need to be a square peg in a round hole. There are many paths to follow in this field. If you know what attracts you the most, you can begin to work towards gaining knowledge and experience in that area. Here are 12 ways to slice it. You may even think of more.</p>
			<h3>1. Designing for Different Types of Learning Experiences</h3>
			<p>Some instructional designers specialize in designing for one particular type of media or learning format and others are comfortable designing for many types.</p>
			<p>Some formats that instructional designers work with include: online training (eLearning and webinars); educational games; video; television; instructor-led training (writing manuals and making slides); self-paced print guides; mobile learning (for digital tablets and mobile phones); job aids (print or mobile); audio only (podcasts and CDs); and social media, including wikis, blogging and curating content.</p>
			<h3>2. Corporate, Nonprofit, Academia or Government</h3>
			<p>An organization's mission and purpose can make a big difference in the type of work an instructional designer performs. For example, a corporate environment might be geared toward improving sales or developing custom work for clients. Designing in a higher education environment often involves training and working with faculty on their distance education courses.</p>
			<p>Working in a school system may involve designing curriculum or helping teachers with educational technology. Government work might involve managing vendors who create the courses or creating training for large departments in the government.</p>
			<p>And nonprofit work, such as that for an association, might involve designing and delivering training to member chapters around the country.</p>
			<h3>3. Internal, Client-based, or Commercial Products</h3>
			<p>Many organizations hire instructional designers to create internal training for their own employees. Others create custom content for external clients or develop education and training products for the marketplace.</p>
			<p>The pressures, deadlines and focus of each of these approaches will affect the intensity of the workplace environment.</p>
			<h3>4. Audience Type</h3>
			<p>With preparation and a little luck, you can choose whether you want to design learning experiences for children, teens or adults. There are products for primary school ages and those for upper grades.</p>
			<p>Or you might break into designing for college and university students. You can also focus on adult workplace training and adult training for personal development.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, not all age groups are equally funded, so it may be more difficult to find a job with one particular group. You'll have to see what's available in your area or be willing to move.</p>
			<h3>5. Content Specialist/Subject Matter Expert</h3>
			<p>Instructional designers are typically content neutral. This means we design and develop for any subject. Some instructional designers, however, concentrate in one field.</p>
			<p>This may happen when they start out as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and transition into an instructional design role or they simply work in one content area for an extended time and develop into experts. If you have a special area of interest or knowledge, this path might be for you.</p>
			<h3>6. Technical Specialist</h3>
			<p>Authoring tools are the programs that we use to assemble the media, interactions and content that make up eLearning courses. Quite a few instructional designers migrate partially or wholly into the technical development side. Becoming an authoring tool specialist may involve gaining competence in several authoring tools, like Articulate Storyline and Adobe Captivate. It may also involve building learning portals (websites), creating mobile learning products and other technical tasks. In organizations with a one-person design team, the instructional designer does both design and development.</p>
			<h3>7. Media Specialist</h3>
			<p>In smaller organizations and academic centers, instructional designers wear many hats, which may include audio and video production and editing, as well as creating graphics.</p>
			<p>Some fall in love with this side of the industry and become multimedia specialists, using their instructional design know-how to ensure their productions are instructionally sound.</p>
			<h3>8. Project Management</h3>
			<p>All design and development projects require planning and management and some instructional designers develop the skills to create and follow through on project plans.</p>
			<p>Those interested in this path should get supplemental training, as project management often requires exceptional people skills, business savvy, and knowledge of project management applications.</p>
			<h3>9. Curriculum Design</h3>
			<p>Through instructional design one can take a big picture view and help school systems, higher education and organizations develop curricula. The curriculum designer analyzes the standards, goals and purpose of a curriculum and devises high-level learning strategies to meet these goals.</p>
			<p>Curriculum designers might also be involved in selecting instructional materials, defining certification requirements and creating assessments.</p>
			<h3>10. Learning Management System Specialist</h3>
			<p>Some large organizations and institutions require at least one full-time person to manage their Learning Management System (LMS). An LMS is the software product that stores and launches courses as well as tracks student and employee coursework.</p>
			<p>Technically-minded instructional designers may take on this position. Large LMS products can be complex and require special training from the vendor to make full use of the program's capabilities.</p>
			<p>The LMS manager ensures the system is running smoothly, trains others in its use, creates standards for the many detailed issues that arise, and troubleshoots technical problems.</p>
			<h3>11. Community Management</h3>
			<p>As informal learning becomes increasingly accepted by organizations, there will be an increasing need for people who can build and manage communities of practice. These are groups with shared common interests. Community managers must understand the cognitive and emotional benefits of learning from group interactions and discussions.</p>
			<p>The community manager oversees online relationship building, content creation and the use of social media tools. Community managers may initiate and monitor discussions, find ways to engage participants and create and enforce community rules.</p>
			<h3>12. Team Size</h3>
			<p>Do you prefer to be a one-person band or to work on a large team? The size of the group can greatly affect what you do every day as an instructional designer.</p>
			<p>On solo or small teams, designers are responsible for the analysis, design and production of learning experiences and materials. With the advent of tools for creating eLearning quickly, an increasing number of companies are using very small teams.</p>
			<p>On large teams, designers are often responsible for just the analysis, design and writing or storyboarding, while other team members take care of the multimedia elements, authoring (working with authoring tools) and programming.</p>
