			<h2>Lesson 1: Itâ€™s A Moving Target</h2>
			<h3>Welcome!</h3>
			<p>Greetings and welcome to your first lesson on breaking into the field of instructional design and technology. There is no one path that will work for everyone, so ultimately you'll need to find an individual path that works for you. That's why I'll lay out a wide range of options as these lessons progress.</p>
			<p>Every one of you is starting from a unique place. Perhaps you helped develop a course one time and you got bit by the instructional design bug. Perhaps you're a recent graduate from an instructional design program but can't seem to land that first job.</p>
			<p>Or perhaps you have a fuzzy idea of what an instructional designer does and you're intrigued by thoughts of a possible career change helping others learn. Wherever you're at, these lessons should broaden your horizons and help you manifest new opportunities.</p>
			<h3>Hold On to These Lessons</h3>
			<p>I'll list resources throughout many of the lessons, so please take a moment now to create a folder in your email Inbox to keep them in one place. This will make it much easier for you to find a lesson when you need the information. Now, let's get on with things.</p>
			<h3>You're Not the Only One Who's Confused</h3>
			<p>Many fields are well-defined and have been so for decades. Instructional design isn't one of them. We more or less know what a teacher, nurse or lawyer does every day. We have a common understanding (though it may be superficial) of what these careers entail. Not so for instructional design.</p>
			<p>Not only is instructional design a little-known field, it's transforming and adapting right now, as you read these very words. The convergence of new technologies and cultural changes paired with a growing understanding of how the brain works and how people learn is causing seismic shifts in the field.</p>
			<p>These shifts will probably change the role of the instructional designer in the future. Instructional design is a moving target. It's also an exciting and dynamic career.</p>
			<h3>A Traditional View of Instructional Design</h3>
			<p>Traditionally, instructional design refers to the systematic process of creating or selecting learning experiences (both materials and activities) that are based on principles of educational psychology and human performance.</p>
			<p>For example, an instructional designer could do any of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create an eLearning course that teaches employees about sexual harassment.</li>
				<li>Write a storyboard that teaches how to refurbish laptops and then hand it over for a developer to produce.</li>
				<li>Write instructor and participant manuals teaching how to use Excel that a trainer uses in a classroom setting.</li>
				<li>Write a persuasive video script for a company's anti-smoking campaign.</li>
				<li>Design a children's educational math game.</li>
				<li>Make a job aid that call center employees use to answer customer questions.</li>
				<li>Design a distance education curriculum for a college.</li>
				<li>Evaluate and select commercially produced online courses that teach effective team communication.</li>
				<li>Write pre- and post-test questions for a course that a team member is producing.</li>
				<li>Conduct quality control testing on commercial training products that your company produces.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this role, the instructional designer creates, selects or contributes to the creation of instructional materials with the goal of enhancing skills, knowledge and attitudes in some way that can be measured.</p>
