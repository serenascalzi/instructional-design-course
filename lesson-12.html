			<h2>Lesson 12: How to Create an Instructional Design Portfolio</h2>
			<p>If you were a hiring manager, would you find it helpful to see a job candidate's portfolio of work samples? I imagine your answer is <em>yes</em>. The value of creating a portfolio can not be overestimated. This lesson will get you started on the path to creating work samples as part of your resume. Be sure you listen to this <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/podcasts/51" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a> or download the transcript. There are a lot of tips and good advice on building portfolios and the show notes list a lot of tools.</p>
			<h3>The Portfolio Explained</h3>
			<p>A portfolio (digital or paper-based) of instructional design and eLearning samples allows you to showcase your skills and to document your work. It can include any media that demonstrates your abilities.</p>
			<p>Consider the skills and knowledge you want to develop and what you'd like to show a potential employer. Suggestions include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instructional design work (design document, training manual, eLearning storyboard)</li>
				<li>eLearning design samples (a few short running lessons)</li>
				<li>Graphic design skills (screens that you've designed)</li>
				<li>Production skills (such as working with authoring tools, recording audio or video)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you don't have any of these skills or assets yet, you can learn to develop them. See my suggested process at the end.</p>
			<h3>Six Benefits of Creating a Portfolio</h3>
			<p>A well-made portfolio:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Demonstrates your capabilities rather than lists them in a resume</li>
				<li>Develops the practical skills you'll need for instructional design</li>
				<li>Allows you to get feedback from others so you can improve your work</li>
				<li>Can be continually updated to document your career</li>
				<li>Projects a 21st century persona</li>
				<li>Allows room for personal creativity and expression</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>For eLearning, Study Examples</h3>
			<p>If you're not familiar with a variety of online learning lessons and games, check out some of the examples listed below.</p>
			<p>Don't get frustrated if an example seems very advanced. It was most likely created by experienced professionals. You will eventually reach that level too!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://community.articulate.com/e-learning-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Articulate eLearning Examples</a>: Another set of eLearning demos from the folks at Articulate.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.elearningcyclops.com/p/free-elearning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free eLearning</a>: See Jeffrey Goldman's list of eLearning examples.</li>
				<li><a href="http://educationalgames.nobelprize.org/educational" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobelprize.org</a>: Although many of these lessons are "page-turners," meaning they aren't much different from a book, check out the game <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/laser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laser</a> for something different.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Start Your Own Portfolio</h3>
			<p>Being new to all of this, you're probably wondering how to get started on creating your own portfolio. I've outlined a path below, but read this first:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Time and effort required.</strong> Building a portfolio will take some work and study. Once you go down this path, however, you will continue to learn and improve.</li>
				<li><strong>Only show quality work.</strong> If you're not satisfied with your final work, don't show it. The skills you learn along the way will be immensely valuable. In terms of eLearning, you can show storyboards rather than running lessons. It is better to show great storyboards rather than amateurish running lessons.</li>
				<li><strong>Get a second opinion.</strong> Consider getting a second opinion from a colleague in the field as to the quality of your portfolio.</li>
				<li><strong>There's more than eLearning.</strong> Although I've stressed an eLearning portfolio here, there are other options. You can think beyond discrete courses. For example, you could design and document an approach to professional development that ties together an online discussion group; performance support (print, online or mobile job aids); and a series of audio interviews with experts. Be sure to clarify your ideas with depth and detail.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This <a href="https://myelearningworld.com/instructional-design-portfolio-samples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> has links to 23 example portfolios. I haven't looked through all of them, but you'll probably be able to tell whether some are beautiful and some can be improved.</p>
			<h3>Create Several Short Lessons</h3>
			<p>Here's one way to go about creating a brief five or ten minute lesson. Consider creating several lessons on different topics.</p>
			<h4>1. Select Your Topic</h4>
			<p>Choose a topic relevant to the type of work you will ultimately be seeking. For example, if you want to develop adult training for the workplace, select a common training topic, such as IT security, leadership skills, project management, etc. If you want to develop educational courseware, select a topic relevant to the appropriate age group.</p>
			<h4>2. Read A Few Books</h4>
			<p>Using a book or two on instructional design or eLearning (see the list from the previous lesson), walk through the steps of creating a lesson, documenting the process along the way. This documentation, if well-written, can also become part of your portfolio. If you analyze your audience, for example, then this analysis document can showcase your skills.</p>
			<h4>3. Storyboard the Lesson</h4>
			<p>Create a rough storyboard of your lesson. Read this article on storyboarding: <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/storyboards-for-elearning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storyboards for eLearning</a>. Then download a storyboard template from my <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/resources/storyboard-depot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storyboard Depot</a> on The eLearning Coach. Your storyboards can be sketched with geometric shapes and stick figures or done in PowerPoint and Word. The most important aspect is your approach to the instruction. Make it unique, engaging and interactive.</p>
			<p>You may want to make an entire portfolio of clean and thoughtful storyboards. Continue to gain experience in graphics and authoring tools, as listed below, but you may decide your portfolio should stop at the storyboard stage.</p>
			<p>A hiring manager recently told me that in his estimation, a portfolio of very good storyboards is better than non-professional quality eLearning. His company has a larger team where the graphic designer and developer create the eLearning and the IDs conceive the ideas and write.</p>
			<h4>4. Learn to use a Graphic Program</h4>
			<p>You'll need graphics in your eLearning courses, which means you're bound to need a graphic editing program. Here are programs ranging from free to $100.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.gimp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIMP</a>: This may be the most powerful free graphic editor</li>
				<li><a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/resources/image-editing-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other free graphic editors</a>: My list of free image editing software</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Office-Student-Windows-Download/dp/B07H4XBM1R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=software&ie=UTF8&qid=1543668336&sr=1-3&keywords=Powerpoint&linkCode=sl1&tag=theelearningc-20&linkId=83417b6bbd94e608cf8886b3ecffb706&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PowerPoint</a>: If you're going to use a PowerPoint-based authoring program, you may find that its graphic editing capabilities are surprisingly powerful.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adobe-65292215-Photoshop-Elements-2019/dp/B07HKQDL7Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1543667508&sr=8-4&keywords=photoshop+elements&linkCode=sl1&tag=theelearningc-20&linkId=5471fb56a38a922713c6f62420b15de0&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photoshop Elements</a> costs around $100 (U.S.) and is a consumer version of the professional Photoshop program.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>5. Learn to Use an Authoring Tool</h4>
			<p>An authoring program is the software that assembles the graphics, text, media and interactions into a running lesson. These tools range in price from free to over $1,000. The two most popular authoring tools--Articulate Storyline and Adobe Captivate--have moved to subscription pricing (bummer). If you are a beginner, you may not want to spend too much money on an authoring tool. Below are some suggestions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://iseazy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isEazy</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.easygenerator.com/?utm_campaign=elearningindustry.com&utm_source=%2Fdirectory%2Felearning-software%2Feasygenerator&utm_medium=link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easygenerator</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://courselle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Courselle</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.courselab.com/view_doc.html?mode=home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CourseLab</a> (free)</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.debugmode.com/wink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wink</a> (free, good for creating software tutorials)</li>
				<li><a href="https://camstudio.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CamStudio</a> (free, records your screen)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Pricey Tools with Free Trials:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://articulate.com/360/storyline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Articulate Storyline 360</a>: These folks have created a warm and welcoming community for instructional designers as well as good help for learning their products.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Captivate</a>: This is a powerful authoring tool and the latest version is advertised as having VR capabilities. I think Captivate is a bit harder to learn than Storyline.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.ispringsolutions.com/ispring-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iSpring Suite</a> (for use with PowerPoint) Although this product is now expensive, you can get a 10% discount on iSpring Suite using this code at checkout: QQU7-G9QX-4ZS6.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>6. Continually Test Your Ideas</h4>
			<p>As you work through your design and development cycle, run your prototypes, storyboards and running lessons by sample members of the target audience or anyone willing to help. Get feedback on what is clear and what is difficult to understand or use. Revise as needed. If you're not familiar with prototypes, read <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/learning-prototypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
			<h3>Another Idea: Volunteer</h3>
			<p>You can also build a portfolio and gain experience from volunteering your new instructional design skills to an organization you value. Most organizations and institutions have something they would like to teach or communicate. Use this approach for building a portfolio.</p>
			<p>You can expect one more email lesson from this course. Stay tuned!</p>
