			<h2>Lesson 9: Best Places to Network for an ID Career</h2>
			<p>It helps to think of online networking as participating in a community. As you engage with people by asking questions, contributing comments, offering encouragement and sharing your own knowledge, you will slowly get to know people as well as learn from them. This is how to build enduring relationships.</p>
			<p>Here are some of the more popular online networking communities.</p>
			<h3>LinkedIn Groups</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> is considered one of the premiere social sites for finding jobs. It's also a wonderful space for learning through group forums. If you haven't updated your profile and you're a job seeker, it pays to keep it current. Some recruiters and HR staff search through LinkedIn for job candidates.</p>
			<p>With your profile updated, join and participate in LinkedIn Groups related to the career path you are seeking. For example, try searches for "eLearning," "instructional design," and "educational technology" in the LinkedIn Groups area. Here are a few of the many groups related to Instructional Design and eLearning on LinkedIn.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/58371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instructional Designers</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/102144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The eLearning Guild</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/27003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning, Education and Training Professionals Group</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/48422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Association for Talent Development (ATD)</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Facebook</h3>
			<p>Join a few relevant Facebook groups. Don't be shy about asking questions and commenting or starting discussions. Some eLearning and instructional design groups on Facebook are listed here.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/elearningcoach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The eLearning Coach</a> (my FB page where you can post comments/questions as well as find daily links to articles)</li>

			<h3>Twitter Chats</h3>
			<p>For fast-paced conversation, engage in Twitter chats and watch the conversation scroll by in 280 characters. I'm referring to the organized chats on Twitter for learning and education professionals. (You can find the protocols for using Twitter all over the Internet.)</p>
			<p><strong>Use a Twitter Chat Tool</strong></p>
			<p>The easiest way to participate is to use an online chat tool, like <a href="http://tweetchat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TweetChat</a> or <a href="http://twubs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twubs</a>. At the given date and time (see the chats below), enter the hash tag (#) for the chat of your choice in the Search box. Twitter Chat tools automatically list the real-time conversation from all participants, not just people you follow on Twitter. They can typically add the chat hash tag to your tweets so others will know you're engaged in a chat.</p>
			<p>Here are three regular Twitter Chats for learning professionals just for starters. Click each one for more information.</p>
			<p><strong>1. Learnchat: <a href="https://lrnchat.wordpress.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#lrnchat</a></strong></p>
			<p>Takes place Thursday nights from 8:30-10:00 PM ET. Learning professionals of all backgrounds and levels of experience are welcome to discuss learning trends and technologies.</p>
			<p><strong>2. Guild Chat: <a href="http://twist.elearningguild.net/2014/09/introducing-guildchat-the-new-twitter-chat-for-learning-professionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#GuildChat</a></strong></p>
			<p>Meets every other Friday at 2pm ET/11am PT. The chat is structured around a set topic and a series of questions designed to spark conversation.</p>
			<p><strong>3. Inside Online Learning: <a href="https://www.onlinecolleges.net/inside-online-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#IOLChat</a></strong></p>
			<p>Meets Wednesdays at 12PM ET. Covers all topics related to online learning and online teaching.</p>
			<h3>In-person Networking</h3>
			<p><strong>Meetups</strong></p>
			<p>Meetups are local gatherings for people with similar interests. Check if there are any meetups happening in your area or region that are related to training, instructional design, learning experience design or educational technology. You can search and sign up at <a href="https://www.meetup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meetup.com</a>. You can also start your own meetup group.</p>
			<p><strong>Professional Associations: Local Chapters</strong></p>
			<p>Some of your best networking opportunities might be close to home. If you live in a populated area there may be a local chapter of a professional association where you can get involved.</p>
			<p>Local chapters of professional associations (some are in the list below) often have monthly meetings as well as special events with speakers and workshops.</p>
			<p><strong>Professional Associations: Conferences and Workshops</strong></p>
			<p>You may find networking at industry conferences to be valuable. These conferences often consist of pre-conference workshops and training events, standard presentations, and organized opportunities for networking and socializing.</p>
			<p>Here are prominent professional associations and industry organizations that host at least one in-person conference event a year related to instructional design and technology, online learning, performance improvement or educational technology.</p>

			<h3>Internal Networking</h3>
			<p>If you are already part of an organization that has instructional design positions or could conceivably need an instructional or eLearning designer, consider networking within your current place of employment.</p>
			<p>You may see opportunities within your current job to expand your role into training. If appropriate, consider writing a proposal with your ideas and discuss them with your manager or supervisor.</p>
