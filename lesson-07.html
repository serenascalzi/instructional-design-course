			<h2>Lesson 7: Job Outlook and Pay</h2>
			<h3>Job Outlook Data</h3>
			<p>It's difficult to collect and discuss global salary information so I focused on the U.S. However, the eLearning Guild Salary Report, linked to at the end, is one resource that addresses global salaries.</p>
			<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that jobs for Training and Development Specialists (we have so many different titles!) will grow by 11% from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. The report goes on to say, "Job prospects should be best for those with experience developing online and mobile training programs."</p>
			<h3>Pay Scale for Instructional Designers</h3>
			<p>According to <a href="https://www.indeed.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indeed.com</a>, an employment website, the average salary for instructional design positions as of November 2018 was $63,870. This number was based on 1,735 salaries submitted anonymously to Indeed by instructional design employees, users and collected from past and present job ads (for the past 36 months). It mentioned instructional designers being in their positions for a year.</p>
			<p>This is less than what the eLearning Guild, a professional association, reports. The Guild 2018 survey states that the average salary of an instructional design professional in the US is $84,421. Assume this average is for people with several years of experience. The Guild survey also states that "the field had a healthy climb of 5.6% growth in average salaries over the past seven years, with 1.5% growth this past year. Salary growth rates are exceeding the rate of inflation." See a link to this report in Resources below.</p>
			<p><strong>Additional Compensation Counts</strong></p>
			<p>The eLearning Guild report also adds that many eLearning professionals received additional compensation in the form of continuing education, tuition reimbursement and bonuses. Keep this in mind if you're looking for a new job.</p>
			<p><strong>What about newbies?</strong></p>
			<p>As you might expect, salaries vary according to industry, years of experience and specific position and job responsibilities. Note that these numbers reflect <em>average</em> salary, not what you might expect for your first job in the field.</p>
			<p>Although there is variation in salary growth, over time the eLearning compensation tends to grow with years of experience. The eLearning Guild reports that globally, salaries of people with 10 to 14 years of experience were 11.3% higher than the global average salary.</p>
			<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
			<p>Average salaries also vary by location, influenced by regional economic trends. The Northeast has the highest salaries and the midwest has the lowest, according to the eLearning Guild report.</p>
			<p><strong>Gender Matters</strong></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, there is a worldwide gender pay gap for eLearning professionals. In the US, women reported an average instructional design salary of $80,280 and men reported an average salary of $92,490 in the 2018 data.</p>
			<p>I'm not sure how to stop this trend, other than to say that if you are a woman, become competent in the skills you'll need, do salary research in your region, and don't be scared to negotiate.</p>
			<p><strong>Looking Beyond Salary</strong></p>
			<p>Let's not forget that salary is not the only motivator for selecting a career. If you find the idea of impacting lives by helping people learn, then you will probably find this career fulfilling and engaging. Consider how much a personally fulfilling career means to you. The eLearning Guild report stated that respondents to their survey have a high level of job satisfaction, with 90% reporting "they are either very happy or somewhat happy in their jobs."</p>
			<h3>Job Outlook Snapshot</h3>
			<p>To provide you with a snapshot of the U.S. job market in November 2018 (not necessarily the best month for hiring because of the upcoming holidays), I searched major cities in the U.S. for "instructional design" jobs on <a href="https://www.indeed.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indeed.com</a>. I used quotes in the search term to ensure a better match.</p>
			<p>The number of full-time opportunities that resulted from the search is shown in parentheses. This does not include contract and part-time jobs. It does not include a search for "elearning." Because I did not investigate each opportunity, take this as a very general snapshot.</p>
