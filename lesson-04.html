			<h2>Lesson 4: The Competencies of Instructional Design</h2>
			<h3>What is the instructional design process?</h3>
			<p>Although the approaches people use to design and develop learning experiences vary, the common denominator is that the process is systematic and iterative. For course development, the process typically involves:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Analysis and research to define the requirements and specifications</li>
				<li>Designing and prototyping a solution</li>
				<li>Development and production</li>
				<li>Quality Control, testing, evaluation and more fine-tuning</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The instructional design process results in a set of one or more learning experiences or support to assist employees in building skills and improving performance.</p>
			<p>Perhaps you have heard of the ADDIE model, an acronym for Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. ADDIE is probably the most well-known and often used model for training design and development. But it has its critics. Some think that this model no longer meets the needs of the 21st century learning environment.</p>
			<p>Practitioners also use approaches based on Agile design models. These models are iterative and they are based on several cycles of design-prototype-test. By prototyping and testing ideas on users early in the process, you are more likely to create useful and effective learning experiences than when you test at the end. The Successive Approximation Model (SAM) by Michael Allen and Action Mapping by Cathy Moore are two methodologies for this. See links to their books in the Resources at the end of this lesson.</p>
			<p>As you gain experience, you will find the approach that is right for your learners, their learning needs and environment and your project. Don't be surprised to hear criticism of whatever approach you choose!</p>
			<h3>Competencies of the Instructional Designer</h3>
			<p>The tasks the instructional designer performs are so varied that it would be difficult to list them all. Fortunately, the IBSPI (International Board of Standards for Training, Performance and Instruction) has a list of instructional design competencies I'd like to share with you. These competencies are brief and obviously do not include everything, but it will give you a sense of what instructional designers might do. Not every instructional designer performs all of these tasks, as some are more typical of an advanced career.</p>
