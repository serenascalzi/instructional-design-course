			<h2>Lesson 2: A New Mindset</h2>
			<p>In the previous lesson, we saw that the traditional role of the instructional designer is to create, select or contribute to the creation of instructional materials. The goal is to enhance skills, knowledge and attitudes in some way that can be measured. Most organizations today probably use instructional designers in this role.</p>
			<p>But things are changing. If you know where the field is headed, you can adopt a forward-thinking outlook in the workplace. You can learn to stay up-to-date and maintain a flexible and open attitude about learning. These are important traits for success in instructional design.</p>
			<h3>The New Learning Experience (LX) Designer</h3>
			<p>In the future, count on the role of the instructional designer, training specialist or instructional technologist to be broader. This new role can be described as a "learning experience designer." This moniker is slowly catching on to describe instructional designers and I'm hoping the trend will continue.</p>
			<p>Rather than thinking in terms of creating discrete one-time learning events, the learning experience designer creates, selects or supports a wide range of learning experiences to meet a work performance or educational goal.</p>
			<h3>How to Be a Learning Experience Designer</h3>
			<p>In addition to delivering or <em>pushing</em> instruction, the LX designer also supports learners as they find ways to fulfill their own learning needs. People will increasingly <em>pull</em> the content or instruction they choose at the time they are ready for it. This role is more learner-centric.</p>
			<p>For example, an LX designer might do any of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create an eLearning course that teaches business writing in the workplace.</li>
				<li>Then schedule an online webinar where employees can ask an expert writer questions regarding business writing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Or a learning designer might:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Teach interested employees how to use social media to stay up-to-date in their field.</li>
				<li>Show staff how to set up a Twitter account and find relevant experts to follow.</li>
				<li>Develop a website to collect content from around the web on a particular topic, annotate and manage it. This is known as content curation.</li>
				<li>Help people in different fields find respected blogs that cover the latest trends in their area of expertise.</li>
				<li>Create and manage an online community of practitioners to encourage knowledge sharing and to break down organizational barriers.</li>
				<li>Bundle online videos, podcasts, and online articles into a free-form learning experience that employees use as needed.</li>
				<li>Design a virtual reality training experience to practice performing a dangerous task in a safe, simulated environment.</li>
				<li>Work with a technical team to design a chatbot (program that simulates human conversation) that provides customer support.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, a learning designer could:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Observe the work performance problems employees are having in the field.</li>
				<li>Work with a programmer to design a mobile performance support app. The app would enable employees to look up the information they need while out in the field.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>A Comparison</h3>
			<p>In the traditional role, the workplace instructional designer is typically focused on courses. These courses are sponsored by a higher-up in the organization. They are intended to meet compliance laws or to close a knowledge or skill gap that a supervisor has deemed important.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, 21st century instructional designers takes a broader view of things. They will examine a problem closely and determine whether the solution requires training or whether some other experience or strategy is needed.</p>
			<p>The LX designer will support and facilitate the performance of tasks and learning, however it is needed or initiated. The learning might be formal or informal, initiated at the top or by the learner.</p>
			<p>As you might expect, many organizations and institutions do not yet have a 21st century outlook. It's probably fair to say that at this moment, many people involved in training and instructional design are not yet aware of the changes that are coming. Yet the increase in personal mobile devices, the connectedness resulting from social media and the ubiquitous presence of the Internet are bound to change the learning and development function everywhere.</p>
